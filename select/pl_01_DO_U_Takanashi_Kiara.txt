Ooh
Hey
I don't wanna stop it yet
(Ooh-wah)
Playin' Russian Roulette
(Ooh-wah)
Yeah boy as soon as
I saw you I knew it (yeah)
Baby it's you, oh ya, now
Got me love drunk
I'm knocked down, down, down
There's somethin'
special about you (Uh-huh)
When I see you I know it's true
Oh ya, now
Gotta getta ya,
oh ya, now, now, now
If it ain't you
baby then I'm done
(Yeah yeah oh girl,
you know it!)
I just can't resist you
Your eyes are like a spell that
I can't break through
And that should scare me
But I don't know baby
You're captivating me
And in the end you'll let me go
That's just what we do...
Love, Hate
All the same
If you know
Play the game
I'm all locked up-up inside
No I can't fight the feeling
and I won't try
Love, Hate
All the same
If you know
Play the game
Baby you decide
If you want me then shout it out
right now!!
Love is just a game
I can't complain,
I do the same, Oh!
DO U? DO U? Say
You do feel the same
Spark me like a flame
I know I'll never be the same,
Oh!
DO U? DO U?
In the end love's
just all a game
Don't ever let yourself fall in
(yeah)
You got it? (Uh)
'Cause love's just like a toxin
(Uh-Uh)
The way pain is so common
Your problem, I can't solve it!
(Nope)
I'm just a fool in love
Know that this more than a crush
(Ahh~)
So you can't save me
I'm in too deep
And I love the rush, yeah
I just can't resist you
Your eyes are like a spell
that I can't break through
And that should scare me
But I don't know baby
You're captivating me
And in the end you'll let me go
That's just what we do...
Love, Hate

If you know
Play the game
